        <p class="section-subheading">We are fundraising to help flood-affected people in Sylhet, Bangladesh. The flood situation in Sylhet has worsened in the last two days and people are finding shelter in any place where they can just survive. Although people have shelter to survive now there are no foods or medical supplies there to support them. My main goal for fundraising is to provide flood-affected people with food and medicines. Your donation will be gratefully appreciated and support those people who are surviving now in a tiny shelter homeless, passing sleepless nights.</p>

                <p> Education brings self-discipline, a sense of responsibility, team-work among children and prevents them from feeling social insecurity. It helps in being self-confident and a good decision-maker. Hence, every child must be educated so that they can lead a happy life.</p>
